Final project

TODO: Create one Python program or notebook.

Due date: Last day of lectures (Nov 24th)

Work in groups of 1-3. (will assign in class)

All in group submit same files/links to Github/etc/ - Github link is highly preferable, also submit zip of your program files as well

first comments of your program should contain teammate names

Ideas for final project:

Games - text only is fine
tic-tac-toe

hangman

battleship

bulls and cows - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows

any other game

Nice to have: Player Vs Computer and Player vs Player modes

Scoreboards, personalization, high score keeping

File cleaning/processing application
User has an option to submit file name(even better directory) and some sort of processing is done and file(s) is/are converted to another format

TXT-> TXT, CSV-> EXCEL, JSON<->XML, PDF -> EXCEL etc

Web automatization/scraping project - Using Selenium
read information from web page/s and save to some file format/database

or perform some tasks on web page/s

Data Analysis project
usually involves loading CSV/SQL/Excel into Pandas dataframe and doing some visualizations -

Data Mashup project
Find 2 or more API sources (most likely JSON API) extract some data and combine in some new way

Some ideas from previous students works
Baltic electricity market prices automatic scraping/parsing and alerts

Music tone playback for training music theory

Extract exercise text from education PDFs and create new assignments for students from this text.

Simple text adventure game

Machine learning project that reads plastic bottle images and sorts them.

Main requirement - code has to be Python
Program size 100 lines is probably decent, could be a bit less, 500 lines is probably a bit much already. 1000 lines would be extreme but impressive.
